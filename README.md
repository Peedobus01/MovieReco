# MovieReco — Personalized Movie Discovery Platform

A full-stack MERN application that uses **TMDB** as the movie data source of
truth while all personalization, ranking, ratings, and recommendation logic
is implemented independently. A second-stage **LLM layer (Google Gemini)**
reranks and explains recommendations in plain language, with the app staying
fully functional if the LLM is ever unavailable.

This is not a streaming or booking platform — it's a discovery tool that
helps you decide what to watch next.

## Features

- **Auth** — JWT-based register/login, bcrypt password hashing
- **Home** — live "Trending," "Most Popular," "Top Rated," and "Recently
  Released" rows pulled directly from TMDB, cached server-side
- **Discover** — structured filters (title, up to 2 genres, director, actors,
  min. rating, year range, runtime, language), ranked by a custom weighted
  scoring formula (Bayesian rating + popularity), not just TMDB's raw order
- **Movie Details** — full info, cast/crew, TMDB rating alongside your
  platform's own live-updating **community rating**
- **Ratings & Reviews** — 5-star ratings with optional text reviews;
  ratings incrementally update your derived taste profile
- **Watchlist** and **Recently Viewed** tracking
- **Profile** — stats, favourite genres/directors/actors, and two Chart.js
  visualizations (genre distribution, rating distribution)
- **Recommendations ("For You")** — a two-stage hybrid engine:
  1. Your backend generates a ranked candidate pool from TMDB using your
     rating history (recency-weighted) or a neutral trending pool for new
     users / explicit search requests
  2. Gemini reranks the shortlist and writes a short "why this fits you"
     explanation for each pick — restricted to *only* recommending movies
     from that shortlist, and the app falls back to deterministic ranking
     seamlessly if the LLM is unavailable or a quota limit is hit
  3. Supports natural-language requests like *"an emotional sci-fi movie
     like Interstellar but less complex"*

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or later, and npm
- A free [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register) account
- A free [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) account
- A free [Brevo](https://www.brevo.com/) account (for sending password reset emails)
- A free [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) account (optional — the app works without this, just without AI-generated explanations)
- Git

## 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd MovieReco
```

## 2. Get your API keys

### MongoDB Atlas (database)
1. Create a free cluster at [mongodb.com/cloud/atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
2. Once your cluster is ready, create a database user (Database Access) and note the username/password
3. Go to Database → Connect → Drivers → copy the connection string
4. Replace `<password>` with your database user's actual password, and add a database name (e.g. `/cinematch`) right before the `?` in the URL
5. Under Network Access, allow your current IP (or `0.0.0.0/0` for local dev simplicity)

### TMDB (movie data)
1. Sign up at [themoviedb.org/signup](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup)
2. Go to Settings → API → Request/Create an API key (choose "Developer," any reasonable use-case description works)
3. Copy the **API Key (v3 auth)** value

### Brevo (email sending)
1. Sign up for a free account at [brevo.com](https://www.brevo.com)
2. Go to Senders & IPs and verify your sender email address
3. Go to SMTP & API → API Keys and generate your `BREVO_API_KEY`

### Gemini (optional — AI-generated recommendation explanations)
1. Sign in at [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) with a Google account
2. Create an API key — no billing setup needed for the Flash/Flash-Lite models
3. **Important:** Do NOT add this key to your `.env` file! Instead, launch the app, log in to your account, and navigate to the **Profile** page. There you will find an input box where you can securely save your Gemini API Key directly into your user profile. The app will use this key specifically for generating your personalized explanations.

## 3. Backend setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the new `.env` file and fill in your real values:

```dotenv
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=any_long_random_string
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d

TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
TMDB_BASE_URL=https://api.themoviedb.org/3
TMDB_IMAGE_BASE_URL=https://image.tmdb.org/t/p

EMAIL_USER=your_verified_gmail_address@gmail.com
BREVO_API_KEY=your_brevo_api_key_here

CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

Start the backend:
```bash
npm run dev
```
You should see `MongoDB connected` followed by `MovieReco backend running... on port 5000`. If either line is missing, double-check the corresponding `.env` value.

Quick sanity check in a separate terminal:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

## 4. Frontend setup

Open a **second terminal** (leave the backend running in the first one):
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser. Vite automatically proxies
all `/api/...` requests to the backend on port 5000, so no CORS setup or
extra `.env` file is needed for local development.

## 5. Using the app

1. Register an account (or log in if you already have one)
2. Browse **Home** and **Discover**, or open any movie's details page to
   rate it and add it to your watchlist
3. Once you've rated 3 or more movies, visit **For You** for personalized
   recommendations — or type a specific request like *"a dark thriller
   crime movie like Se7en"* or *"a high-octane superhero movie like Batman
   Begins"*
4. Check your **Profile** page for stats and taste charts

## Notes & known limitations

- Movie metadata is never duplicated locally — TMDB is the single source of
  truth for all movie data. Only ratings, watchlist entries, recently-viewed
  history, and derived preferences live in your MongoDB database.
- The recommendation engine's rating-based profile only drives the
  **no-query** "For You" view. An explicit search request intentionally
  ignores your rating history so results aren't biased toward your usual
  taste when you're deliberately asking for something different.
- Gemini's free tier has daily request quotas that vary by model; if
  recommendations unexpectedly show generic explanations instead of
  personalized ones, this is usually why — check the backend terminal log
  for the exact reason (it logs the specific failure every time).
- Reference-title matching (e.g. "like Interstellar") depends on TMDB's own
  `/similar` and `/recommendations` endpoints, which aren't perfect — very
  obscure or unusually stylized titles can occasionally be mismatched.

## Tech notes worth knowing (useful for interviews / code review)

- **Two-stage ranking**: the backend computes its own Bayesian-weighted
  rating + popularity score to rank TMDB results, rather than relying on
  TMDB's default single-field sort.
- **Incremental community rating**: updates in O(1) per new rating via a
  running sum/count on a lightweight `MovieStats` document — no aggregation
  query needed on read.
- **Recency-weighted preferences**: recommendation generation (separate from
  the lifetime stats shown on the Profile page) applies exponential decay to
  older ratings, so recent taste shifts matter more than a rating from a
  year ago.
- **LLM as a second-stage reranker, not the recommender**: candidate movies
  always come from the backend's own deterministic logic first; the LLM
  only reorders and explains a shortlist it is not permitted to deviate
  from, and the app remains fully functional if the LLM call fails, times
  out, or hits a quota limit.
